### INSTRUCTIONS
- analyze the image data and return all the components and all the text labels that you can identify
- rely on existing CSS as well as Twitter Bootstrap CSS classes to create a complete HTML file that represents:
  - the wireframe as per the image data
  - ALL components & design elements that are present in the image data
  - ALL the labels and text of the image
- make sure the HTML file covers the following sections:
  - page layout and sections
  - component relave positions to each other and the grid
    - look at both vertical and horizontal component position in relation to the grid and one another
  - components within each section
  - component classes, sizes, and positions

  - make sure components do NOT overlap
- use Twitter Bootstrap

- use icons from Font Awesome to make sure all the elements are clear
- add pastel colors. colors are very important to make the design look good
- use DataTables to represent the table data
- don't include the CSS code in the HTML file, but make sure to reference the CSS file in the HTML file: <link rel="stylesheet" href="app.css">
- (!) pay extra attention to the location of the components in relation to each other and the grid.

- provide a full, valid HTML output only. no headers, footers, backticks, or additional text.
- start your response / HTML output from "<!DOCTYPE html>" and end with the closing tag "</html>"
- the HTML file should import these in the following order:

- local, previously generated, CSS: app.css
- remote jQuery library
- remote "popper.js"
- remote "bootrap.js"
- remote dataTables js
- remote dataTables js (for bootstrap 4, "dataTables.bootstrap4.js")
- local, previously generated, JavaScript file: app.js

  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.4.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
  <link href="https://cdn.datatables.net/2.0.3/css/dataTables.bootstrap4.css" rel="stylesheet">

Please analyze the provided image and generate a detailed row-by-row description of the user interface.

You are also optinally given a user feedback to focus on. Please return it in the response as well.
### USER FEEDBACK
{focus}

For each row, include the following details:

1. Row number and overall description
2. Components present in the row (e.g., navigation bar, buttons, input fields, images, text, etc.)
3. Size and dimensions of each component (e.g., width, height, padding, margin)
4. Alignment and positioning of components within the row (e.g., left-aligned, right-aligned, centered, evenly spaced)
5. Text content, labels, and placeholders for each component
6. Color scheme and visual styles applied to components (e.g., background color, font color, font size, font weight)
7. Any specific interactions or behaviors associated with components in the row (e.g., hover effects, click actions)
8. Responsive behavior for different screen sizes (e.g., stacking, wrapping, resizing)

Please provide the description in a clear and structured format, separating each row with a heading and using bullet points for individual components and their details. Be as specific and comprehensive as possible to ensure accurate implementation by the Engineer agent.

Example format:

Row 1:
- Description: Header section with navigation menu
- Components:
  - Logo image (width: 150px, height: 50px, left-aligned)
  - Navigation menu (right-aligned, evenly spaced)
    - Menu items: Home, About, Services, Contact (font: Arial, size: 16px, color: #333333)
  - Background color: #FFFFFF
- Responsive behavior:
  - On screens below 768px width:
    - Logo and navigation menu stack vertically
    - Menu items collapse into a hamburger icon

Row 2:
...

Please proceed with the image analysis and provide the row-by-row description, and at the end provide the original user feedback unchanged ({focus}).
