# INSTRUCTIONS
As the {role}, your task is to review the engineer's feedback on the user story and provide clarifications while ensuring the user story remains concise and focused on a single unit of work.

Consider the following guidelines:
1. Address the specific questions or points raised by the engineer.
2. Provide clear and concise clarifications without adding unnecessary details.
3. Ensure that the clarified user story still aligns with the overall feature requirements.
4. Keep the user story focused on a single, well-defined unit of work.
5. Use simple language and avoid ambiguity or vague statements.
6. If the engineer has confirmed that no clarification is needed, simply return the original user story.

you task is to return the clarified acceptance criteria of the original user story. ALL in the Gherkin format (Given/When/Then). and NOTHING ELSE: no headers, no footers, no explanations, just the user story.

Return the acceptance criteria of the original user story clarified in the following JSON format:

"Given <precondition>,",
"When <action>,",
"And <additional action>,",
"Then <expected outcome>.",
"",
"Given <precondition>,",
"When <action>,",
"And <additional action>,",
"And <additional action>,",
"Then <expected outcome>.",
"",
"<additional acceptance criterias>",
...

make sure the final acceptance criteria covers ALL the points raised by the engineer
AS WELL AS the previous acceptance criteria, so no context is lost

* Use clear and concise language
return this acceptance criteria without any additional text, headings or footers: just a list of acceptance criteria in Gherkin format.

Example Usage:
Input:
[Web App Idea]: Color Palette Generator
Description: A web app that generates color palettes based on user input, allowing users to discover and save color combinations for their projects.

Output:
Title: Color Palette Generator

Description:
The Color Palette Generator is a web app that helps users create, discover, and save beautiful color palettes for their design projects. Users can input a base color or select a random color, and the app will generate a visually appealing color palette based on color theory principles. The app will display the color palette along with the hex codes and RGB values for each color. Users can adjust the brightness and saturation of the colors, save their favorite palettes, and export them for use in their projects.

Requirements:
1. Color input: Allow users to input a base color using a color picker or by entering a hex code.
2. Random color generation: Provide an option to generate a random base color for the palette.
3. Color palette generation: Generate a visually appealing color palette based on the base color using color theory principles (e.g., complementary, analogous, triadic).
4. Color palette display: Show the generated color palette with the hex codes and RGB values for each color.
5. Color adjustment: Allow users to adjust the brightness and saturation of the colors in the palette.
6. Palette saving: Enable users to save their favorite color palettes for future reference.
7. Palette export: Provide options to export the color palette as an image or CSS code snippet.

User Interface:
The Color Palette Generator should have a clean, intuitive, and visually appealing user interface. The main section of the app should display the generated color palette, with each color shown as a large swatch along with its hex code and RGB values. The color input and random color generation options should be prominently placed above the palette. The color adjustment controls should be located below the palette, allowing users to easily tweak the brightness and saturation. The save and export options should be easily accessible, with clear labels and icons.

Functionality:
The app should use JavaScript to handle color input, generation, and manipulation. When a user inputs a base color or selects the random color option, the app should generate a color palette using predefined color theory algorithms. The generated colors should be displayed dynamically on the page, with their hex codes and RGB values updated in real-time. The color adjustment controls should use range sliders to allow users to modify the brightness and saturation of the colors. The adjusted colors should be updated instantly in the palette display. The save functionality should store the user's favorite palettes in the browser's local storage, while the export options should generate downloadable files or copy CSS code snippets to the clipboard.

HTML Structure:
The HTML structure should be semantically marked up and include the following main elements:
- Header with the app title and navigation menu
- Main section with the color input, random color button, and color palette display
- Color adjustment controls below the palette
- Save and export buttons
- Footer with any necessary information or links

Use appropriate classes and IDs for styling and JavaScript manipulation.

CSS Styling:
The CSS should provide an attractive and responsive design for the Color Palette Generator. Use a clean, modern color scheme that complements the generated color palettes. Ensure proper spacing, alignment, and sizing of elements. Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for the layout, and apply hover and focus states for interactive elements. Make the app responsive and mobile-friendly using media queries and relative units.

JavaScript Interactivity:
Use JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality to the app. Implement the following features:
- Color input and validation
- Random color generation
- Color palette generation based on color theory algorithms
- Real-time updates of color swatches, hex codes, and RGB values
- Color adjustment using range sliders
- Saving and loading of favorite palettes using local storage
- Exporting palettes as images or CSS code snippets

Organize the JavaScript code into modular functions and use descriptive variable and function names for clarity.

Additional Considerations:
- Implement accessibility best practices, such as proper color contrast and keyboard navigation support.
- Optimize the app's performance by minimizing DOM manipulation and using efficient algorithms for color generation and manipulation.
- Add error handling and validation for user inputs to ensure a smooth user experience.
- Consider adding a feature to share color palettes on social media or via unique URLs.
- Provide a help section or tutorial to guide users on how to use the app effectively.

By following this prompt, an AI model should be able to generate a self-sufficient and functional prototype of the Color Palette Generator web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The prototype should fulfill the specified requirements, provide an engaging user interface, and demonstrate the core functionality of the app idea.
